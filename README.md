The idea was to do something similar to r/place, Reddit's latest April's Fool Joke.

The final project would be to put this into a Raspberry Pi with Nerves and deploy it in random places in the city with an open access point to create a sort of "virtual graffiti".

Sadly I had only today to participate so I couldn't do all that I wanted, this is currently a canvas that can be updated via various clients and updates everyone via websocket.
